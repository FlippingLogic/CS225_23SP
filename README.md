I'm more than happy to share my idea and coding experience with you, if it's allowed by your college's code. CS225 is one of the most suffering but also interesting course I have taken. But this course does worth it.

#### No guarantee of correctness. I'm sure there's several zero scored lab contained here, because of carelessness or environmental problems. Compling can be really tricky, make sure your code can compile on your TA's computer before submission! This is my most heartfelt advice.

Good luck, my fellow students!
